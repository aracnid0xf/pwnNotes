Say you are a normal user on a Linux box:
- to check commands yuu can run with sudo, use 
```bash
sudo -l | grep NOPASSWD
```
This will list the binaries the user can run with `sudo` but don't require password checks.

- Thou can then go ahead to `GTFObins` to see if you can get a reverse shell on root session with any of the binaries you have. _sleek_ `¶(*¬+)`.
